        <h2> Sources and Acknowledgements </h2>
        This site uses many scientific data sets and software tools that have been made available
        to the public at no cost.  These contributions are greatly appreciated.  They include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The asteroid and cometary orbits used are derived from the data published
                by the <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net">IAU Minor Planet Center</a> at the Center for Astrophysics.
                The current release uses the data in the 
                <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/Extended_Files/mpcorb_extended.json.gz">mpcorb_extended.json.gz</a>
                and 
                <a  href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/Extended_Files/cometels.json.gz">cometels.json.gz</a> files
                that were available in early February 2021.
                Over 1 million asteroids are available, but we extract 50,000 entries from these data.
                The first 5,000 objects in each of the classes defined by the MPC are included.  For many classes
                this means that all objects in that class are included.  E.g., all comets and all of many asteroid classes
                are included.  Thus the rendered asteroids drastically underemphasize the dominance of main-belt asteroids
                in currently detected objects.

                The planetary ephemerides are derived from 
                <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf">E.M. Standish, Keplerian Elements
                    for Approximate Positions of the Major Planets </a>.  Currently the elements for the
                    starting time of the simulation are used for full span of the orrery calculation.  Ultimately
                    we anticipate transitioning smoothly as the elements evolve.

                Data for the stars within 100 pc are taken from the Gaia DR3 Nearby Stars catalog supplemented
                by SIMBAD information
                <a href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=V/137D/XHIP">The Extended Hipparcos Catalogue</a> is used
                when the galaxy=small flag is used in the URL.
                Here all data with a measured parallax of &gt; 25 milliarcseconds from this source are included in the sample.  This gives
                just 3000 nearby stars rather than the 300,000 in the GAIA sample.  The larger sample taxes
                graphics hardware.                
            </li>
            <li>
                The <a href="https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid"> SIMBAD </a> name resolver is used to support
                searches for stars not within the sample used parsecs and for stars using names other than the those which are included
                in data we have downloaded.  Note that in addition to the Hipparcos sequence number we also include the SIMBAD
                principal identifier for an object.  These are 'expanded' from the form used in SIMBAD.  E.g.,  SIMBAD
                uses the name "alf Cen A" rather than "Alpha Centauri A".  When an object is identified in SIMBAD
                but we can use the identifiers returned by SIMBAD to match to an object in the local copy of elements ofthe XHIP catalog,
                the local information will be used to ensure that users get the same result regardless of the name used.

                Information on the extrasolar planets was extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive using
                their <a href='https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS'> query interface</a>.<!-- comment -->
                All exoplanets which had a Hipparcos ID were extracted, but only the number of planets in the
                system is currently used.
            <li>
                 Data on satellites orbiting the Earth collected by NORAD is retrieved using the facilities
                 of <a href="https://space-track.org"> Space-Track.org</a>.  The current release uses the satellite
                 data as of late August 2021.  Note that while we include precession terms for the orbits
                 no other changes are currently in place so that orbits more than a few weeks from the collection time
                 are more illustrative than accurate.

            <li> The Earth imagery and the code for displaying it was taken from <a href='http://thematicmapping.org/playground/webgl/earth/'>this site</a> which
                illustrates using three.js to display an Earth sphere.
            </li>
            <li>
                Images (textures) of the planets and many satellites were found in public sources.   The source for each image is visible by clicking on the image.
                The is a small industry in creating these images and we anticipate adding more
                as we go forth.

                Much of the mathematics of the orbital element translations is succinctly described in documents describing the transformations from
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418175843/https://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5070/handouts/cart2kep2002.pdf">coordinates to elements</a> 
                and 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810015111/http://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5070/handouts/kep2cart_2002.doc">elements to coordinates</a>.
                Thanks to the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> for keeping links to these documents alive!

                The three dimensional visualizations are provided using the capabilities of the
                <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> library.  The amazing simplicity of that
                library (given the power it provides) was the driver for providing this tool directly in JavaScript.
                The documentation for this library is somewhat cryptic, so many thanks to the myriad people who
                have asked and answered questions and put up amazing demonstrations of what is possible.

                This web page was built within the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> framework.
                This was primarily to enable us to use the abilities of the compilation framework to 
                combine and compress component JavaScript files rather than a need for compliance to the React conventions.
                In particular very little of the state of the canvas is maintained within the state of React
                components so that animations have few direct dependencies on React.  However
                many of the controls, and the forms used in the Orbit and Trajectory calculators
                use React extensively.

                Earlier versions of this toolkit used <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material-UI</a> components, 
                but more recent versions no longer do so.
