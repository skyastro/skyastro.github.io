        <h2> Sources and Acknowledgements </h2>
        This site uses many scientific data sets and software tools that have been made available
        to the public at no cost.  These contributions are greatly appreciated.  They include:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The asteroid and cometary orbits used are derived from the data published
                by the <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net">IAU Minor Planet Center</a> at the Center for Astrophysics.
                The site uses the data in the files 
                <a href="https://minorplanetcenter.net/Extended_Files/mpcorb_extended.json.gz">mpcorb_extended.json.gz</a>
                and 
                <a  href="https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/Extended_Files/cometels.json.gz">cometels.json.gz</a>. 
                Over 1 million asteroids are available in the original dataset, but we extract about 57,000 entries 
                from these data.
                The first 3,000 objects in each of the classes defined by the MPC are included.
                For many classes
                this means that all objects in that class are included.  E.g., all comets
                are included.  The rendered asteroids drastically underemphasize the dominance of main-belt asteroids
                in currently detected objects.  The nominal goal of the selection was to extract 50,000
                objects from the sample. All named objects are included and this pushes the number
                up a bit.  Updates to the small body data are made using the OrbSupport GetSMB program.
                The MPC updates these files on a daily basis.  The OrbSupport GetSmb class reads the input
                files and generates a single input file for the program.  This file was current as of <span id="smbEpoch" ></span>.                
            </li>
            <li> Information on the satellites and debris orbiting the Earth are derived from NORAD using
                the interface provided at <a href="https://www.space-track.org"> Space-track.org </a>. Note that
                only the gross precession of orbits is handled so that except very near the time of the
                ephemeris, the orbits should be treated as illustrative rather than definitive.  NORAD data is
                updated using the OrbSupport GetNORAD class.  Each orbit is given an epoch which can 
                sometimes be a few days in the future.  We use the latest epoch as the nominal time
                for the data.  The current
                orbits have a nominal latest epoch of  <span id="satEpoch"></span>.
            </li>
            <li> Mission data for the interplanetary missions was retrieved from the
                <a href=https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons> JPL Horizons service</a> using its
                Batch API.
                For each included mission a set of ephemerides was extracted and processed
                using the missionfinder main.js program.  This invokes the HorizonsQuery jar.
                This program creates an orbit chain which approximates the mission
                orbit for a sequence of periods.  Normally the mission is followed only during the time
                it is interplanetary.  Missions that go on to orbit (or land on) other planets
                are not followed after they reach their destination.  If the mission is in an
                interplanetary orbit at the end of the JPL orbit coverage, the last valid orbit
                is used subsequently.  Missions are included only when they actually launch, but
                once launched the Horizons predicted trajectories are used to give the orbit at future dates.
                
            </li>
            <li>
                The planetary ephemerides are derived from 
                <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/txt/aprx_pos_planets.pdf">E.M. Standish, Keplerian Elements
                    for Approximate Positions of the Major Planets </a>.  The elements for the
                    starting time of the simulation are used for full span of the orrery calculation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Natural satellite orbit information was taken from mean ephemerides provided by JPL.  These are currently available
                on <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sats/elem/">their web site</a> in a queryable table but the version used in the Orrery
                used a PDF which no longer seems to be accessible.  This had slightly older information.  Information on
                the rotation orientation of the satellites (which is used for satellite animations) was generally
                extracted from Wikipedia articles on each satellite.   For the satellites where we have image
                information, the orbital and rotation periods are generally the same.  The rotation phase is generally not
                easily accessible other than for the Earth's Moon.

            <li>
                Data for the stars within 100 pc are taken from the Gaia DR3 Nearby Stars catalog supplemented
                by SIMBAD information and planetary information from the NASA Eoxplanet Archive.
                <a href="http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=V/137D/XHIP">The Extended Hipparcos Catalogue</a> is used
                when the galaxy=small flag is specified in the URL.
                Here all data with a measured parallax of &gt; 25 milliarcseconds from Hipparcos are included in the sample.  This gives
                just 3000 nearby stars rather than the 300,000 in the GAIA sample.  The larger sample taxes
                typical graphics hardware.  Names for the objects were generated by matching with SIMBAD and 'expanding' 
                from the form used in SIMBAD.  E.g.,  SIMBAD
                uses the name "alf Cen A" rather than "Alpha Centauri A".
                <p> The development of the Local Galactic Neighborhood is complex.  We
                    need to supplement the Gaia data with SIMBAD data for brighter stars and the planetary
                    data from the NASA Exoplanet archive.  Currently this requires us to 
                    transform between DR2 and DR3 Gaia identifiers which in turn involves analysis
                    of the cross-match data provided in the DR3.  Much of the code in this
                    process is found in the OrbSupport gaia package.
                </p>

                The <a href="https://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid"> SIMBAD </a> name resolver is used to support
                searches for objects not within the sample used and for aliases other than the those which are included
                in data we have downloaded.  Note that users can search for galaxies or clusters of galaxies
                when in nearby animations, and for stars while looking on cosmic scales, to get a sense of the relative
                directions of various astronomical objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                Information on the extrasolar planets provided in the local galactic neighborhood was extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive using
                their <a href='https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PS'> query interface</a>.
                All exoplanets witin 150 pc were initially extracted, but planet data was
                used only if a match to a GNS catalog or SIMBAD star within 100 pc was found.
            <li> Data on nearby galaxies uses the Karachensev, et al., Catalog of Nearby Galaxies,
                extracted using the HEASARC's <a href='https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xamin'>Xamin service</a>.
                There this catalog is designated neargalcat.  The orientation of the galaxies in
                space uses a cross-correlation with the  de Vaucouleurs RC3 catalog to get an estimate of the
                position angle for galaxies.
                Where not found the position angle is taken as 0 degrees.  In this animation
                galaxies of numerical galaxy class 0-7 are shown with disks whose orientation and inclination
                are determined by the position angle and inclination of the galaxy. The size of the galaxy is
                taken from the linear diameter field.  The JSON file used is generated by
                the OrbSupport GalaxyParser class.

            <li> The Earth imagery and the code for displaying it were taken from <a href='http://thematicmapping.org/playground/webgl/earth/'>this site</a> which
                illustrates using three.js to display an Earth sphere.
            </li>
            <li>
                Images (textures) of the planets and many satellites were found in public sources.   The source for each image is visible by 
                double clicking on the image.
                The is a small industry in creating these images and we anticipate adding more
                as we go forth.
            </li>
            <li>The image of the moon is from the <a href='https://solarviews.com/cap/moon/moonmap.htm'>
                    SolarViews web site.</a></li>

                Much of the mathematics of the orbital element translations is succinctly described in documents describing the transformations from
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160418175843/https://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5070/handouts/cart2kep2002.pdf">coordinates to elements</a> 
                and 
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170810015111/http://ccar.colorado.edu/asen5070/handouts/kep2cart_2002.doc">elements to coordinates</a>.
                Thanks to the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> for keeping links to these documents alive!
                A more leisurely and comprehensive discussion of these topics is <a href='Orbits.pdf'>included</a> in the Orrery documentation which is
                in part based upon these documents.

                The three dimensional visualizations are provided using the capabilities of the
                <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> library.  The amazing simplicity of that
                library (given the power it provides) was the driver for providing this tool directly in JavaScript.
                The documentation for this library is somewhat cryptic, so many thanks to the myriad people who
                have asked and answered questions and put up powerful demonstrations of what is possible.

                The <a href="https://github.com/nodeca/pako">pako</a> JavaScript decompression
                libraries allow us to use compressed versions of dynamically
                downloaded data files.  The compressed files are about
                a third of the size of the originals.

            <li>
                This web page was built within the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> framework.
                This was primarily to enable us to use the abilities of the compilation framework to 
                combine and compress component JavaScript files rather than a need for compliance to the React conventions.
                In particular very little of the state of the canvas is maintained within the state of React
                components so that animations themselves have few direct dependencies on React.  However
                the animation controls, and the forms used in the Orbit and Trajectory calculators
                use React extensively.
