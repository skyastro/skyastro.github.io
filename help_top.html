        <h2> Orrery Help </h2>
             This web site provides a number of distinct but often interacting capabilities enabling
             users to visualize elements of the universe in 3D.
	   <ul> 
               <li> The <strong>Solar System Orrery</strong> shows major and minor components of the solar system.  
               Positions of the planets, asteroids and comets are shown.
               The orbits and positions of the planets are shown, but currently no moons are displayed.
               The positions of 50,000 minor planets and comets are also given.  
               Data are taken from the Minor Planet Center of the Center for Astrophysics.  
               Positions for these minor bodies for times more than a few years from the present are
               not accurate since we are using a current epoch orbit.
               Future upgrades may use update orbits appropriately for the time shown in the orrery.
               The MPC divides Solar System bodies into a variety of categories, the orrery view shows 
               the firest 5,000 of each of these (where there are more than 5,000 in the category). 
               Thus rarer classes are preferentially shown, since all known objects in those
               categories may be displayed.  A few spacecraft missions may also be  presented. 	  
               <p>
               You can zoom, pan and rotate the view at any time.
               You can start and stop the orbits, set the time, speed up or slow the passage of time.
               You can also highlight a particular orbit, show the orbit specified in the Orbit Calculator, 
               or interact with trajectory set up in the Trajectory Controller.
           </li>
           <li> <strong>The Earth and environs </strong> shows the Earth, Moon and ~22,000 objects orbiting
               the Earth that are being tracked by NORAD.  The orbits of all of the satellites
               are shown and users can click to find particular objects as in the solar system.
               However since orbits of the satellites are strongly affected by the atmosphere,
               controlled burns and non-two body gravitational interactions, these orbits should
               not be extrapolated very far, and the simulation will normally start at the time of
               the downloaded satellite ephemerides.  The lighting of the Earth and Moon by the Sun
               is modeled and spheres show the features of both of these bodies.  Although artificial
               satellite orbits are shown at the proper distances relative to the Earth, the orbit
               of the Moon is shown very much closer its actual distance.  This scaling can
               be modified.
               
           <li> The <strong>Local Galactic Neighborhood</strong> renders the stars in the local Galactic neighborhood, within 40 parsecs, using Hipparcos 
           positions and parallaxes.  A parsec is 3.2 light years, and is comparable to the distance to the nearer stars.
           Hipparcos will ultimately be replaced by GAIA.  Stars where the NASA Exoplanet Archive shows one or more
           planets are surrounded by colored rings.
           As with the solar system you can zoom, pan and rotate the image around the Sun.  
           You can also highlight the path between any two stars and get the distance between them.
           If the vector origin is not updated, you will get the distance from the Sun.
           For this feature you can show a path to stars that are beyond 40 pc so long as 
           SIMBAD has a measured parallax for the star.  
           An animation showing the space motions of the stars is also available.  You can 
           show a vector while the simulation is running.  E.g., you can see how the distance to
           Proxima Centauri is decreasing for the next few centuries.
	   <li> 
           The <strong>Orbit Calculator</strong> enables a user who can give some elements of an orbit to calculate others. 
           Fill in whatever information you have on the orbit and see if the full orbit can be determined.
           Note the distinction between elements that are constant along the orbit,
	   and those that vary with time.  If an orbit is fully defined in the orbit calculator
           the orbit can be shown in the Earth or Solar System simulations if the mass of the
           central body matches that of the Earth or Sun.
           </li>
	   <li> 
               The <strong>Trajectory Controller</strong> allows a user to transform one orbit into another using
	   a set of specified accelerations. The status of this page is currently in flux.
