<h2>Frequently asked questions </h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>[General] How do I get from one animation to another?</strong>  There are a number of ways
        to change the current animation.  Within the solar system, double clicking on a planet or its orbit
        will get you to the animation for that planet.  
        
        <p>
        If you double-click very close to the corners of the
        image, you can get to the base animation for the current animation, usually the animation in which the
        current animation is embedded, so you can go from a Ganymede->Jupiter->Solar System->Local Galactic Neighborhood->Nearby Galaxies->Clusters.
        Since the clusters animation is cannot be embedded in anything larger, its base animation is the nearby galaxies.  
        </p>
        <p>
        If you search for objects, those which
        have their own animation often have an icon to click to go to the animation.  Double-clicking on the Milky Way in the Nearby Galaxies,
        will take you to the Local Galactic Neighborhood, and double-clicking on the Sun in the Local Galactic Neighborhood will
        take you to the Solar System.
        </p>

        Direct links to the Earth, Solar System, Local Galactic Neighborhood and Nearby Galaxies animations are 
        available in one of the options in the three-dots menu.

    <li><strong>[Solar System] Why isn't Venus shown as a cloudy white ball? </strong> We used a topographic map of Venus rather than
                the rather boring optical image.  Similarly the image for Titan is taken in a band
                which shows many more features than our eye might pick out.
    </li>
    <li><strong>[Solar System] Why doesn't Pluto's orbit look like it comes inside Neptune's?</strong>
This is a perspective issue.  The Solar System orrery shows what you might see if you were looking from a very specific position in the solar
system (initially 6 AU directly above the Sun perpendicular to the ecliptic plane).  The portion of Pluto's
orbit where it is nearer to the Sun than Neptune is also well above the ecliptic plane, so  in perspective it can show as outside Neptune's orbit from some perspectives.
You can rotate the view around and get other perspectives where you can see the orbits crossing.
    <li><strong>[General] What do the colors mean?</strong>
The colors of the planets and Sun were set to help identify them, e.g., Mars and its orbit are red.  The Sun is yellow.
<p>
Asteroids and comets are classified by the Minor Planet Center into a variety of categories.  The single
character fields are for comets and prefix the name (e.g, 1P/Halley) and the longer named categories are used in their asteroid list.
The Jupiter Trojans and Hilda asteroids can be seen near Jupiter's orbit. (The Hilda's just inside the Trojan
locations or opposite Jupiter).  The MBA (main belt asteroids) are the overwhelming majority of detected objects
but only about 30,000 are shown here of the more than 1 million known.  The other categories generally reflect the
orbit of the object. We chose to emphasize rarer categories, so the density of discovered objects in the main belt
is dramatically understated.    

These categories were given essentially arbitrary but distinguishable colors as noted.  The brightness is adjusted based
upon the absolute brightness of the object according the MPC ephemerides.

    In the Local Galactic Neighborhood the color of the stars mostly reflects the spectral type:
<pre>
    Red:          M
    Orange:       K
    Yellow:       G
    Yellow/White: F
    White:        A
    Blue/White:   B
    Blue:         O
    Green:        White dwarfs and a few oddballs
</pre>
Some stars have colored rings.  A violet ring indicates a single planet, a blue ring 2 planets and
a green ring, 3 or more planets.
</p>

In the Earth animation, the color of the satellites is coded such that debris is shown
as red, Starlink satellites are green and others are currently left white.
<p>
    In the Nearby Galaxies animation, the color of each galaxy is related to its
    morphological class going from redder to bluer as we go from Elliptical to 
    Spiral to Irregular (not that the underlying catalog uses the numerical
    De Vaucouleurs galaxy classification not these names).
</p>
<p>In the Abell clusters simulation, the Local Group is the only yellow object.  All
of the other clusters are colored based upon the Bautz-Morgan type, the predominance
of the central galaxy in the cluster.  Bautz-Morgan I clusters are colored red while
bluer colors are used for later types.</p>
</li>
<li> <strong>[Solar System] There seems to be an awful lot of stuff in the solar system.  Why
        doesn't it cause more trouble?</strong>  Well it might and searching for objects
        that may collide with the Earth is an ongoing project for many people, but the actual size
        of the objects in the solar system is much, much, much smaller than depicted here.
        The smallest we can draw an object is 1 pixel, and each such pixel represents a
        cone which is typically about 1 million kilometers on a side and hundreds of
        millions of kilometers long -- a total volume of perhaps a sextillion cubic kilometers.
        That's many times the total volume of the Sun itself.
        Since the typical asteroid is likely just a few cubic kilometers that leaves a lot of
        empty space!
</li>
<li> <strong>[Solar System/Planetary systems] Why is there a small gap in each orbit line?</strong>  This shows the position of perihelion in the orbit.  The gap is the last degree just before the perihelion passage.
</li>
<li> <strong>[Solar System] Why does Halley's comet seem to have an orbit in the main asteroid belt?</strong>
"Halley" is also the name of an asteroid named after the eminent astronomer,  The famous comet is officially named "1P/Halley".
In general comet names are prefixed by a string giving the number and type of the comet.  I.e., 1P/Halley was the first discovered [P]eriodic comet.
</li>
<li><Strong>[Local Galactic Neighborhood] Where is Alpha Centauri B?</strong> 
    Alpha Centauri is a visual binary and the two components (along with their more distant companion
    Proxima Centauri) have different Hipparcos identifiers.  However to the precision of the XYZ positions that
    are used in the Galactic Neighborhood, they have the same position: there are separated by only a few hundred thousandth's of
    a parsec and the neighborhood is 200 parsecs in diameter.  So when the two stars are rendered they are rendered at
    the same spot.  We render G stars, like Alpha Centauri A, as slightly larger spheres than K stars, like Alpha Centauri B.
    So B is entirely closed in A.  When we click or mouse over, the library that finds objects under the mouse, looks only
    for the first object, and that's always A.  But see the next question...    
<li><strong>[Local Galactic Neightborhood] Why do the components of Alpha Centauri come apart as we animate the Local Galactic Neighborhood?</strong>
    While Hipparcos (and SIMBAD) gives the same position for Alpha Centauri A and B, it gives them different velocities, the difference 
    presumably reflecting the orbital velocities of the two stars around one another.  There are no dynamics
    in the animation, so the gravitational forces that would keep the stars together in reality are not simulated.
</li>
<li><strong>[Local Galactic Neighborhood] Why is the Local Galactic Neighborhood simulation not working?</strong> The
    default simulation needs very substantial graphics capabilities to render effectively.
    If it's not working for you you can use a simulation of only about 3,000 stars, instead of the
    300,000 stars, by adding the string ?galaxy=small to the regular base URL.
</li>
<li><strong>[Orbit Calculator] Why are some element lines in the orbit calculator shaded?</strong>
    When a parameter is computed based upon a default value or some formula using known
    parameters, the corresponding row is shaded until the field is cleared.
</li>
<li><strong>[General] I'm using the star connecter feature to show the line between two stars in the Galactic Neighborhood, but the line
        disappears as soon as I release the mouse button.  How can I make the line persistent?</strong>
    The line is created when we detect a mouse-down event on the <tt>Show</tt> button and goes away
when a mouse-up event is seen.  So just move the mouse out of the button while it is depressed.

<li> <strong>[General] How accurate is are the orbits/sizes/etc...?</strong>
    <p>
Generally these animations try to comprehensively model the qualitative features of the
orbits and bodies, but should definitely not be considered authoritative.
Often they used data  well beyond the range in which an ephemeris is accurate.  Planetary and natural
satellite orbits are taken from mean JPL ephemerides which model the evolution of these orbits
but have nothing like the accuracy needed for actual navigation.  
The star data is taken primarily from the Gaia DR3 catalog which
is the best data we currently have, but the precision is not high for distances near 100 pc nor for
the proper motions of many stars.  Orbits for artificial bodies 
orbiting the Earth are taken from NORAD supplied orbits.  However while we model the orbital
precession of satellites (natural and artificial), atmospheric drag and active orbit control of
artificial satellites is not addressed.  The rotation periods of and axes of planets are derived
from public sources (notably Wikipedia) but we have not been able to determine the rotation phase for
most bodies where it is clearly defined (e.g., the inner planets or the Galilean satellites of Jupiter).
    </p><p>
The texture maps used for the planets and some satellites are derived from a variety of sources.
When rendering texture maps the solar lighting places the Sun appropriately
but lighting by the primary is not included.  Shadows are not currently modelled.
    </p>
    <p>
        The angular positions measured by GAIA are quite precise, but the errors in distances and in
        proper motions are much larger.  The shapes of galaxies in the Nearby Galaxies survey are only
        indicated in the crudest way.  Ellipticals and Irregulars are shown as sphere's while SO and Spiral
        galaxies are shown as a combination of sphere and disk with the relative size of size of the sphere
        decreasing from SO -> Sd.  Clusters are indicated as spheres with colors indicating Bautz-Morgan type 
        (predominance of a central galaxy) with the richer clusters shown somewhat larger.  The complexity
        of cluster shapes is not addressed at all.
    </p>
<li><strong>[Earth/Planetary Systems]Why don't satellite's actual movements match the orbits drawn for them?</strong>
    Satellite orbits (both artificial and natural moons) cannot normally be modelled for any significant
    length of time as a two-body orbit since they are subject to the influences of the non-spehrical
    central bodies and the gravity of the Sun.  To first order this causes the orbits to change/precess 
    in certain well-defined ways which the program does model.  However when we draw
    the orbit for a satellite, we draw the instantaneously correct elliptical orbit not including
    precession.  Since the actual orbit of the satellite is not closed, there is no obvious curve
    that 'should' be plotted and by drawing the instantaneous elliptical orbit, we allow users to
    see how the orbit is affected by precession. 
</li>
<li><strong>[Earth] How do I find a satellite given the complex names that the program uses for them </strong>
    You can use wildcards in the satellite name to look for specific satellites.  E.g., to look for HST you can enter *HST*. 
    You may still need to guess a bit.  E.g., *Chandra* won't work, but *CXO* (for Chandra X-ray Observatory) will.
</li>
<li> <strong>[Solar System] Why do some missions disappear?</strong>Generally we don't follow missions after they reach a stable orbit
    around, or land on, some other Solar System body (usually but not always a planet).  However if a mission 
    is in a solar orbit when it ends we use
    the last available orbit for the mission indefinitely even decades after the final manuevers.
</li>
<li><strong>[Solar System] How do you know the orbit of missions in the future?</strong>  We use the Horizons predicted
    orbits for the mission until either the mission is supposed to reach its destination (e.g.,
    Mercury for BepiColombo) or no further manuevers are expected. 
</li>
<li><strong>[Clusters/Nearby Galaxies] Why do the time controls disappear in some animation?</strong>Since we do not know the proper
    motions of galaxies (with a few exceptions) or clusters, it's not possible to model their space motions. So the time display and
    controls are hidden in these animations.
</li>
<li>
    <strong>[Clusters] Why does there seem to be an empty wedge in the clusters animation?</strong>  Clusters at low
    Galactic latitude are difficult to see through the bright Galaxy foreground and so the Abell cluster
    catalog on which this animation is based did not look for clusters there.
</li>
