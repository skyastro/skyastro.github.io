        <h2>Calculating orbit parameters </h2>
        <p> The Orbit Calculator calculates various parameters of an orbit given 
            other information that the user supplies.  Users can supply positions and
            velocities and get the orbit parameters, or enter orbit parameters and get
            the state of the orbit at a given time.
        </p>
        <p> The calculator is a simple speadsheet with a row for each of the parameters supported.
            Each row gives a fiducial name for the element (used throughout the program), an entry field,
            a unit field which gives the allowed unit suffixes, and a short description.
            Initially the user can enter data in any row in the data entry field.  
            Each row in the form is in one of four states: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blank: with nothing showing
            in the text entry field either because nothing has
            ever been entered, or the entry has been cleared by user edits
            or actions of the program.
            </li>
            <li>Non-blank but non-validated:  Some text has
            been entered in the row, but the row has not yet been successfully validated.
            </li>
            <li>Manually entered and validated: the user entered data in the row and
            the program has confirmed that the entry is consistent with the row, e.g., there are
            not extraneous non-numeric characters and that the appropriate number of fields were
            found if the row describes a vector.  In a vector field commas or spaces may
            separate the components and square brackets may be entered to make
            the vector nature clear. A unit field may be given at the end of the
            entry which should match one of the supported units for the row. It must
            be preceded by a space.
            </li>
            <li>Computed: the program has computed the value of the row based upon
            other values the user has entered (or in a few cases based upon default values).  A
            computed row is always validated but cannot be editted by the user.  The row is
            shaded yellow to indicated the computed status.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If the user types Return/Enter after entering
            data, the program attempts to validate the row -- the program checks to see if the value is numeric
            and has the correct dimensionality.  Whenever validation fails a message is shown in the
            <code>Status:</code> field at the top of the form giving the
            reason for the failure.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a row has been validated and the program supports multiple units for the row, a button will appear
            before the unit designations.  The user can click on this button to switch among the various units
            supported for the field.  While the unit will be shown exactly as entered by the user for the input units,
            the value will be shown to
            the current precision scale when any other units are chosen. Changing
            the units does not change the underlying value of the row, just
            the display.
        <p>
            If a row is validated, any editing of that row will undo the validation.  A user can just
            key in a Enter/Return to revalidate.  Edits will also clear any computed row
            which used (directly or indirectly) the now-updated row in its computation.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can try to compute values for rows that have not been manually entered either by typing
            Enter/Return in an empty data input field to update a single row, or by clicking on the Compute button at the bottom
            of the form to compute all currently blank rows.  
        </p>
        <p>
            If you type Enter/Return in an empty field, the program first validates any
            non-blank, non-validated row.  If no validations fail, the program will then attempt to compute
            the row selected, using just the values currently showing.  E.g.,
            if the acceleration, G and central mass have been specified, then the energy can be determined.
            Just enter a return in the entry field of the energy (E) row and the energy of the orbit will be shown.  However if, e.g.,
            G is currently blank, the energy cannot be calculated and nothing will happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>Compute</code> button is more aggressive.  Again it first looks at all
            rows in the form which are non-blank and validates any that
            have not yet been validated.  If no validations fail, it attempts to calculate all of the unknown
            parameters in an iterative way.  When an iteration finishes, if it was successful in computing any parameter
            it tries again for all remaining unknowns, stopping only when no new parameters can be determined from the currently known parameters -- which 
            can include there being no unknowns left.
        </p>
        <p>
            E.g., suppose we want to compute the specific energy of Earth's orbit.
            We type the characters "1 au" (no quotes) in the top row data entry box.  If we then click
            on <code>Compute</code> (without ever typing Enter/Return), the the program will first validate our
            input on the semimajor axis -- successfully we hope!
            Then on a first computation pass the program
            is able to find the default values for the few rows that have defaults since they
            are normally not inferred from other parameters: the central mass (Ms), the mass of the orbiting body (0) and the 
            gravitational constant.  On a second iteration the program then determines the energy and period.
            A third pass nets the number of orbits per day.  As it happens the program
            looks for the N0 before Per: if the order were different it might have found
            all three on the second pass.  Since nothing new is found on the fourth pass
            the computation ceases and the display updates,
            with the semimajor axis field validated and six fields (G, M, m1, E, N0, and Per) shown as computed.
        </p>
        <p>
            To compute an unknown parameter, the program has a set of one or more
            generators for each parameter.  Each generator has a set of prerequisite
            parameters.
            To see if a row is computable, the program loops over the associated set of generators.
            For each generator, the list of prerequisites is compared to the list of known parameters.  When
            a generator where all
            prerequisites are know is found, that generator is used to compute the new parameter.
            There are a few corner cases where a generator fails even with all the
            prerequisites in place. In these cases there are normally other generators
            which can serve as a backup.  Generators with no prerequisites are used to
            set default values for a few parameters: G, M and m1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computed parameters are shown shaded as yellow.  A computed row is always validated, so 
            if there are units available, the user can toggle amongst them.  However it is not allowed
            to edit a computed row, since that would generally
            lead to an inconsistent state for the orbit.  Computed rows must be cleared before their values can be entered
            manually.            
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two explicit clear buttons at the bottom of the form.  The <code>Clear all</code> button returns the form to its
            empty state so you can enter a completely new orbit.  The <code>Clear variables only</code> button clears the
            fields in the orbit that change with time that are shown towards the bottom of the spreadsheet. 
            So a user can enter (or determine), the constants of
            the orbit, then enter a a series of times to get the position of the body a different times along
            the orbit.  Just click <code>Clear variables only</code> before entering each new time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>High precision?</code> toggle affects the number of digits displayed.  Normally
            7 digits precision are shown for scalars and 5 for vector components.  If the toggle is
            set, then 14 digits are shown for scalars and 12 for vector components.  However recall that for 
            manually entered rows when
            the units are the same as when the user entered the data, the row  is shown exactly as the user
            entered it regardless of the requested precision since the users input is deemed
            exact: all unshown digits are 0.  This toggle can be changed at any time.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>Render orbit</code> button is an interface to the animations in E&iB.  A generated 
            orbit can be displayed in the Solar System or Earth animations (depending
            upon the mass of the central body).
            This is the only place where the value of the <code>Name for orbit</code> text box at the top of the form is currently used.
            It labels the orbit in the animation.
            Note that this orbit name is not effective until the user hits an Enter/Return in its entry
            field.            
        </p>
        <p>
            While the program does a little to try to keep the orbit parameters consistent, it is still
            easy to enter inconsistent parameters.  E.g., a user could enter a mean anomaly of 30 degrees and
            a true anomaly of 210 degrees as the first two fields.  It is recommended that users be parsimonious
            in the manual entry of parameters since that minimizes the chances of entering inconsistent data.
