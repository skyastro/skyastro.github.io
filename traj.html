        <h2> Trajectory programs </h2>
        <p>A trajectory for a vehicle can be described using a <i>Trajectory program</i>
            that can be created dynamically while running EaIB, or can be uploaded.
        </p>
        <h3> Starting a trajectory </h3>
        <p>
            Since our program is running in JavaScript on your machine, trajectory programs 
            are uploaded and downloaded using the cut/paste
            mechanism.  To upload a program, stripe a copy into the paste buffer, click on the
            three dots icon, then Orbits and Trajectories/Add Trajectory/Copy Trajectory.  If the
            program parses, the time will reset to just before the earliest time in the trajectory and
            the commands in the trajectory will be executed as the program reaches them.   When uploading
            a program into the program, a user may need to give permission for the program
            to read the cut/paste buffer.
        </p><p>
            To start a manual trajectory, instead of clicking the Copy Trajectory button, fill in the
            entry box after the Start button which and click the Start button.  A rocket will show up
            with the same orbit as the body whose name entered in the Start button.  Then use
            the orientation icon and thrust buttons to enter periods of thrust.
        <p>
            The button pushes will be rendered as a set of THRUST and ORBIT commands.  Save this trajectory
            using the save button as discussed below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Manual thrusts can also be entered after completion of an uploaded program.  The Thrust button is
            deactivated in the middle of the existing program or when running backwards in time.
            Note that the THRUST command uses the current velocity vector in determining the direction of the 
            thrust [By default the thrust is in the same direction as the velocity, but the user can
            specify an angle relative to that, notably including a thrust in the opposite direction.]  The thrust button
            will not execute a command when the velocity is below a minimum (typically 1 m/s) since the direction
            of the thrust may be ill-defined.
        </p>
        <h3> Downloading a trajectory program </h3>
        You can download a trajectory program (which can include manually entered and/or computed commands)
        by clicking on the Save Trajectory button.  This puts the trajectory into you Paste buffer and
        you can then copy this into a file or text editor using the features of the operating system.
   
        <h3>Overview </h3>
        <p>
            A trajectory program is a set of lines that are either comments, or sequential events within the
            program.   There are four kinds of events:  basic trajectory events,
            complex trajectory events, camera events, and miscellaneous events.  Changes to the
            trajectory of the rocket are affected by the basic trajectory events.  Complex trajectory
            events compute how a transfer can occur and insert a set of basic trajectory
            events to effect the transfer, camera events move the position of the camera
            or the point at which the camera is pointing.  Miscellaneous events change
            other aspects of the animation, e.g., displaying comments or affecting the
            speed of the animation.
        <p>
            Comments can be included anywhere in the program by have the first non-blank character
            being '#'.  Lines with only white space are also treated as comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a few exceptions (e.g., when the user parameters are to be echoed to the animation)
            use of any strings in the program (command, parameter and object names) are case insensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            A trajectory program can be created which does not actually have
            a trajectory included, i.e., no trajectory events are included.
            E.g., one could write a program to highlight
            the Voyager missions, giving comments about milestones and moving
            the camera to highlight the events as the missions moved further
            into the outer solar system.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the program execution, some events may cause additional
            events to be generated.   A request to generate a trajectory to Mars
            might generate a set of impulses to be used to effect the transfer.  In
            some cases, a generated event is used to ensure that the animation can
            be successfully run backwards as well as forward.  When a
            program with generated events is saved, the generated events are shown
            as comments with a '#' preceding the event. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each event/command in the program is given on its own line.  An initial token
            gives the time for the event, which can be relative to the previous event or absolute.
            The second token gives the actual command.  Further tokens may give parameters to the
            command.
        </p>
        <h3> General event syntax </h3>
        <p>
            Each event line comprises three fields: the time of the event, the event type, and the parameters
            for the event (which may be optional).
        <p>
            The time of the event may be specified as a Javascript parseable date,
            a Julian Day (followed by JD),
            a modified Julian Day (followed by MJD),
            or days or seconds since the start of 2000 (followed by D or S).
            If the value is a simple number (as opposed to a date with embedded colons or dashes), then
            if it has a magnitude less than 100,000 it is treated as the year (negative years may be
            off by one)
            Otherwise it is treated as a Julian day.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the following are representations of the same instant:
            <pre>
                2000-01-01T00:00:00
                2000.0
                0s
                0d
                2451544.5jd
                51544.0mjd
                2451544.5
            </pre>
       
        <p>
            Dates may also be specified relative to the immediately previous date by prepending with a plus to a number
            and optionally appending a unit.  So if the previous event had one of the dates above, then the
            following are equivalent
            <pre>
                2001-01-01
                +366d
                +1.00207396455y
                +31622400s
                +31622400
            </pre>
            Recall that the year 2000 was a leap year.  The length of a year used for intervals
            is the average length of the year in the Gregorian calendar,
            i.e., 365*400 regular days + 97 leap days equals 400 years.   When a
            trajectory program is parsed, relative dates will be converted to
            absolute dates in seconds since 2000.0.  Since intervals that use units of years use the average length
            of a year, users should be cautious when interpreting a year based interval following a decimal year.
            E.g., as we see above if we have one event at time 2000.0 and the next event marked 
            at the interval +1y, the resulting time
            is actually about 2000-12-31T05:49:12, i.e., it's most of a day before the date we could write as 
            2001.0.  However, when decimal years are used as absolute dates
            the conversion of the fraction of the date takes into account the length of the year specified, i.e.,
            2000.1 is 36.6 days into 2000, but 2001.1 is just 36.5 days after that start of the year.
            All decimal year dates assume a Gregorian calendar.  This also applies to dates computed when
            a duration is part of a command.
        
        <p>
            The date/times of events should be non-decreasing for each line in the
            trajectory.  If not the commands will be reorderd by the parser. 
            The trajectory program is a sequence of events/commands in time order.
        </p>
        <p>
            The command name is given as a single string token separated by white space from the
            preceding time of the event and the optional following parameters.  The value is not case
            sensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameters for commands are illustrated below.  Both keyword and
            positional parameters are used.  Positional parameters should precede keyword
            parameters.
        </p>
        
        <h4> Example </h4>
        This is a legal but not especially useful example to illustrates command syntax.
        The commands are aligned only to aid comprehension.  This is not required.
        <pre>

    # Start in Earth orbit, thrust for 200 s and then compute an immediate (well 1 second later)
    # transfer to Mars.  Center the field of view on the rocket.  At the end of the year we
    # pan back to the Sun at the center of the field of view.

        <h3> Basic trajectory events </h3>
        <p>
            There are six basic trajectory events: ORBIT, COAST, THRUST, ACCEL, IMPULSE and JUMP.
            All of these events can be used in any animation, but ORBIT and THRUST are intended
            for use in scales at the Solar System and below.  For the larger scale animations there
            is no central point body.  Conversely, using COAST and ACCEL within the Solar System is
            unphysical but again perfectly permissible.
       </p>
        <p>
            An actual trajectory starts with an ORBIT or COAST command with parameters.  A user specifies the
            start position and velocity or specifies an object whose position and velocity at the time
            of the event will be used.  In an ORBIT the trajectory then follows the calculated orbit,
            while in a COAST the velocity of the trajectory remains constant.  ORBITs and COASTs without any parameters can be included
            at any time in the trajectory (after the first ORBIT/COAST that had parameters).  These use the current
            position/velocity of the trajectory as the initialization.
        </p>
        <p>
            THRUST and ACCEL are paired similarly to ORBIT and COAST.  Thrust applies an
            acceleration to the trajectory which is simultaneously subject to
            the gravity of the central body.  During an ACCEL no gravity is applied.
        <p>
            During a thrust event, the direction of the acceleration is usually given with reference
            to the direction of the heliocentric velocity of the rocket.  If the speed drops below a limit
            value the direction of the velocity and thus the thrust becomes undefined.
            The thrust will be terminated and the rocket placed in an orbit.  
            A generated ORBIT command will be inserted
            at the point the speed dropped below the threshold (typically 1 m/s).
        <p>
            There is no corresponding issue with an ACCEL, since there the direction
            of the acceleration, even though it was likely determined relative the
            the initial velocity, remains constant.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            IMPULSE applies an instantaneous change to the velocity of the trajectory.
            Since most rocket maneuvers occur in very small times compared to the orbital
            times, this is often an adequate approximation for physical maneuvers.
        </p>
        <p>
            JUMP applies an instantaneous change in the position of the trajectory.
            While this is unphysical (at least under current physics), it allows the
            trajectory to emulate 'jump drive' scenarios seen in many stories.
        </p>

        </dl>
    <h3> Complex trajectory events </h3>
    <p>
        When a complex trajectory event is executed the program looks at the
        requested destination and parameters for the request and determines a
        set of basic trajectory command to effect the transfer which are then inserted
        in the program.
    </p>
    <p>
        Historically there have been several commands used, but we recommend
        use of only two commands.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TRANSFER command calculates the transfer from
        the current location to the requested destination in the requested time.
        The requested destination is normally given as a body, and since the
        time at which the transfer is to be completed is known, the position of
        the body at that time can be easily calculated.
        For any two points there is always one prograde and one retrograde orbit
        that connect the two points in a given interval (not considering
        orbits that move more than one full revolution which may be possible if
        the requested interval is sufficiently large).
        The TRANSFER command
        calculates two impulses.  The first kicks the trajectory from the current orbit
        to the prograde
        solution orbit, and the second takes the trajectory off that orbit and
        matches the orbit of the destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        The TRAJECTORY command has many options and in general attempts to
        minimize the cost (i.e., the total delta V) of the trajectory by adjusting
        the times and directions of the computed impulses.  A destination is required
        and the end time (either explicitly or through the duration) must be given, but
        all other arguments are optional.
    </p>
    <h4> Syntax </h4>

    <pre>
        TRANSFER body duration

        TRAJECTORY DEST=body TSTART=t0 TEND =t1 NMID=n STARTFIXED=xxx
               ENDFIXED=xxx DURATION=dt DURATIONFIXED=xxx SRCVE=vs DSTVE=ve
    </pre>
    <dl>
        <dt><code> body </code></dt> <dd> The destination body </dd>
    <dt><code> duration </code></dt>  <dd>The duration of the transfer (note that
    units may be appended to the number y: years, d: days). Note that
    the start time and duration may be specified as an alternative to the
    start and stop times.</dd>
    <dt><code> t0, t1 </code></dt><dd> The start and stop times within which the transfer
    should occur. The start time may be inferred from the time of the command
    if not explicitly given.  Unless STARTFIXED and/or ENDFIXED are specified, these
    give limits to the time interval within which the transfer is to occur,
    but the actual start and stop times may be within this limit.
    </dd>
    <dt><code> n </code></dt> <dd>The number of impulses in the trajectory excluding
    the impulses at the actual start and stop. </dd>
    <dt><code> xxx </code></dt> <dd>The STARTFIXED, STOPFIXED and DURATIONFIXED keywords
    indicate that the indicated value is not allowed to vary.  The transfer
    must use the indicated value.  The value of these keywords is not used.</dd>
    <dt><code> vs, ve </code></dt> <dd>These give the escape velocities associated with
    the source and destination.  The initial and final impulses do not include
    the effort to escape the source body and get into orbit at the destination.
    The actual delta-V for the initial and final impulses is substantially
    reduced due to the Oberth effect so that most of the impulse will normally
    be done in start/finish impulses. </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3> Camera Events </h3>
    <p>
        Camera events do not affect the motions of any particles, but change
        the perspective of the animation.  We view the animation from a virtual
        camera placed at some location and viewing in some direction.  The camera commands
        can change either of these points.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are three camera commands:  CENTER changes the target or location of the camera
        instantly, while PAN changes the target or location over a specified period of time.
        FOLLOW changes the target or center depending up an object which is being followed.
    </p>
    <h4> Syntax </h4>
    <pre>
        CENTER body  [MOVANT=camera/target] [ZOFFSET=d]
        CENTER x y z [MOVANT=camera/target] [ZOFFSET=d]

        PAN    body duration [MOVANT=camera/target] [ZOFFSET=d]
        PAN    x y z duration [MOVANT=camera/target] [ZOFFSET=d]

        FOLLOW body [MOVANT=camera/target] [ZOFFSET=d]
    </pre>
    <dl>
    <dt><code> body </code></dt> <dd>A body giving the location to be used or followed.
    The value "MyRocket" may be used to follow the trajectory itself.  Note that you cannot
    normally PAN to the MyRocket, though you can CENTER on and FOLLOW it.</dd>
    <dt><code> x y z </code></dt><dd> A location in the current animation coordinate system.</dd>
    <dt><code> duration </code></dt> <dd>The time period over which a pan should be completed.</dd>
    <dt><code> camera/target </code></dt><dd> Should the camera location or the target the camera is
    pointing to be modified? This defaults to the target. </dd>
    <dt><code> d </code></dt> <dd>When specifying a target we often wish to specify a location
    'over' the target so that, e.g., we want to camera to be hover over the rockt.
    This argument allows us to specify in the animation units, the distance we hover over by.
    </dl>

    <h3> Miscellaneous commands </h3>

    <p>
        Several miscellaneous commands are available.  The ECHO command echoes its
        text argument to the animation.  The text will be displayed until another
        ECHO is seen, or until some other action clears the display.
        The SPEED command changes the current rate of
        the animation.
    </p><p>
        The ANIMATION command allows us to switch animations.  The HIDE and SHOW
        commands hide or show elements of an animation.  The ANIMATION, HIDE and SHOW commands
        must use the names of the animations, snf the names given to particular elements.  The
        names of the animations are case-insensitive, but the names of the elements are currently
        case-sensitive.
    </p>
    <p> Animation names include <tt>Solar System</tt>,<tt>Clusters</tt>, <tt>Local Galaxy</tt>, 
    <tt>Nearby Galaxies</tt>, the names of the nine planets, and the names of the large
    moons which are shown are images in the planetary animations (our Moon, the Galilean moons, 
    Titan and Charon).
    </p>
    <p> The HIDE and SHOW commands are most useful in the Solar System animation where you can use
        <i>planet</i><tt>Orb</tt> or <i>planet</i><tt>Orbit</tt> to control the display of the planet itself, or its orbit,
        the names of interplanetary missions, the <tt>Sun</tt>, and <tt>SmallBodies</tt> to add or remove
    the display or asteroids and comets.  In the Earth animation, <tt>satellites</tt> controls
    the display of the satellites.  You can control individual moons in each of the planetary animations.
    using the name of the moon.
</p>
<p>  The names given in the HIDE and SHOW commands can include an asterisk, e.g., <tt>*Orbit</tt>  or <tt>Mars*</tt>.  In this case
    the names of elements in current animation which be matched against the string with the asterisk
    matching any characters.  This is also convenient from matching against names
    that comprise more than one token, e.g., Voyager*1*
</p>
<p>
    The NOROCKET command indicates that no rocket is to be used.  It suppresses
    the features that would normally allow one to start a trajectory.
</p>
<p>
    The SKIP and LOOP commands affect the time sequencing of the animation.
    SKIP jumps ahead a specified amount of time.  There should be commands which
    execute in that interval.  The LOOP command must be the last command of
    the trajectory.  It jumps backwards in time to sometime before the first event
    of the trajectory.  The allows us to automatically rewind and restart the
    animation.

    <dl>
    <dt><code> text to be displayed </code></dt> <dd>Arbitrary text to be displayed.</dd>
    <dt><code> n </code></dt> <dd>The number of steps to speed or slow (if preceded by a -)
    the animation.  Each step changes the speed by a factor of sqrt(2).</dd>
    <dt><code> name </code></dt>  <dd>The name of the animation to switch to.  Normally this
        should be a parent animation (i.e., one level further up in scale), or direct
        child animation.</dd>
    <dt><code>interval</code><dd>The interval before the first event to LOOP to, or
    the amount of time to be SKIPped.</dd>
