                            <li> Updated Local Galaxy Neightborhood delivery process and created
                                new Nearby Galaxy json which includes
                                magnitudes and details about planets in system.
                            </li>
                            <li> Enhanced details about Solar System</li>
                            <li>Moved code involved in creation of LGN to OrbSupport.
                                Substantial updates to the process.
                            </li>
                            <li>Changed information displayed about stars to show new
                                data provided in JSON file.
                            </li>
                            <li> Added PAKO library to enable downloads of compressed
                                information.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Provided compressed versions of source data files:
                                Local galactic neighborhood, solar system small bodies,
                                NORAD TLEs.  These are decompressed using PAKO.  This
                                reduces size of files by a factor of 3 or more.
                            </li>
                            <li>Made planet disks in local galaxy two-sided so they don;t
                                disappear half the time.</li>
                            <li>Updated heuristics for getting rid of planets in SIMBAD data
                            </li>

                        out-of-scale data (e.g., line to Sirius in Solar System)
                    <li>General bug fixes and the like. </li>
