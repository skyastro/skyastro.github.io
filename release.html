                    <li>Facilities for calculating and creating trajectories have been
                    added to the program.  Users can either manually control a rocket
                    or write a program to do the control which can include 
                    atomic events, like specified thrusts or impulses, or calculated
                    trajectories which the program tries to find the 'best' set of
                    impulses for a given transfer. See the <a href=traj.html>Trajectory program</a>
                    documentation for more information.</li> 
                    <li>Earth orbiting articial satellites are only shown after the
                        year in which the associated mission was launched.
